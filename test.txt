We have recieved a python script from a student who took the course last year, that we modified to work
with Fasto. The script is added in the appendix. We liked this script as it made it easy to create subfolders
with test and do selective testing. In DATA we have created 5 testfolders that tests the respective assigment
and one folder named InitialTests, that holds all the given tests. The script should work on most operatives
systems with python installed, but it requires a manual compilation of Fasto, so it is needed to run compile.sh or 
compile.bat before using the script.
With the changing of the test script some modifications to the .out files has been made. The 2 lines of copyrigth
has been ignored and is not part of the suspected output.
The testfile is saved as *.fo, the test input is *.in, the output from the
compiler is *.out and the intepreter output is *.smlout.
