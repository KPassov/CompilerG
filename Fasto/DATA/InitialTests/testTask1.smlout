Program is:



fun bool main( ) = 
  
    let x = read(int )  in  
        let y = 7 in  
            let to =  ( x = y )  in  
                let be =  ( x = 9 )  in  
                    let res =  (  ( to = be )  |  ( to &  ( be = true )  )  )  in  
                        let z = write(res)  in  
                            let w =  (  ( Error unknown input from Parser.sml +  ( y * x )  )  =  (  ( y * x )  - x )  )  in  write(w) 


Input/Output:
